# ðŸ’Œ Mobile Wedding Invitation ðŸ’Œ

![demo1.gif](demo1.gif)

This project is a mobile invitation.

It is developed based on React and Typescript, and provides a fast and easy development environment using Vite.

Eslint and prettier were applied, and emotion/styled was used for styling.

The gallery used react-photoswipe-gallery, and the map used react-naver-maps.

I added a cute confetti function using js-confetti.

4. (Required) Rename the `.env.sample` file to `.env`, and fill in VITE_APP_NAVERMAPS_CLIENT_ID with the `client_id` issued by Naver Cloud. You can obtain the `client_id` after registering the application in [NAVER CLOUD PLATFORM](https://console.ncloud.com/naver-service/application).
5. (Optional) If you want to use the likes and guestbook features, you need to set up Firebase. Set up the Firebase SDK in the src/firebase.ts file. You can set up the SDK by referring to the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup?hl=ko) document.
6. Modify the files that require customization. (See the checklist below)
